<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!--![image1][image1]-->

### Project Description

Research that emerged in 2014, that was very interesting was posted on The World in 2014, with the title “New research on plant intelligence may forever change how you think about plants” by Science Friday. There was stated that “Pollan says plants have all the same senses as humans, and then some. In addition to hearing, taste, for example, they can sense gravity, the presence of water, or even feel that an obstruction is in the way of its roots, before coming into contact with it.”

This essentially states that plants have forms of emotion, and having an app to tell you exactly how to take care of a plant is important. According to an article by Crazy Critters in 2020 “70,000 PLANT SPECIES ARE UTILIZED FOR MEDICINE” which means taking care of plants save people and patients.

Plantly is an interactive plant care mobile application for those who need knowledge on plants and a guide to gardening success.
